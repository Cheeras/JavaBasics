ðŸ”¹ What is XOR (^)?
XOR stands for exclusive OR.

It operates on bits â€” that is, 0s and 1s.

The rule for XOR is:

1 ^ 1 == 0

0 ^ 0 == 0

1 ^ 0 == 1

0 ^ 1 == 1

ðŸ”¹ How swapping with XOR works:
Let's say we have a = 10 and b = 20.

The bit representation might be:

a = 10 -> 00001010
b = 20 -> 00010100
ðŸ”¹ STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION:

a = a ^ b; // (1)
b = a ^ b; // (2)
a = a ^ b; // (3)
Lets compute this carefully:

ðŸ”¹ STEP 1: a = a ^ b
a = 10 ^ 20
    = 00001010 ^ 00010100
    = 00011110  // which is 30
So after STEP 1:

a == 30

b == 20

ðŸ”¹ STEP 2: b = a ^ b
b = 30 ^ 20
    = 00011110 ^ 00010100
    = 00001010  // which is 10
So after STEP 2:

b == 10

a == 30

ðŸ”¹ STEP 3: a = a ^ b
	a = 30 ^ 10
    = 00011110 ^ 00001010
    = 00010100  // which is 20
So after STEP 3:

a == 20

b == 10

âœ… Final result:

We swapped a and b without using a temporary variable!
Originally:

a = 10
b = 20
After swap:

a = 20
b = 10
âœ¨ Summary:
âœ… XOR lets us swap two variables in place without a temporary variable.
âœ… It works by adding information about both into the first variable, then retrieving it in subsequent operations.
âœ… This is a well-established trick, frequently used in coding interviews.
