In Java, static variables are stored in the Method Area (also known as the Class Area or MetaSpace in newer versions of Java like Java 8+).

Memory Location of Static Variables:
Before Java 8: Static variables were stored in the PermGen (Permanent Generation) area of the JVM memory.

Java 8 and later: Static variables are stored in MetaSpace, which is part of native memory (not Java heap). However, they are still conceptually considered part of the Method Area.

Summary:
Java Version	Static Variable Memory Location
Java 7 and earlier	Method Area (PermGen)
Java 8 and later	Method Area (MetaSpace)

Explanation:
Static variables are associated with the class, not instances.

They are loaded into memory when the class is first loaded by the ClassLoader.

They remain in memory as long as the class is loaded in the JVM.

Other Memory Areas in JVM:
Heap – Instance variables (objects)

Stack – Local variables, method call frames

PC Register – Keeps track of the current instruction

Native Method Stack – For native method calls

Method Area (MetaSpace) – Class metadata, static variables, method info
