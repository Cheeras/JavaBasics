In Switch Statements you can jump to various cases based on your expression

Syntax:
		
		Switch(expression){
		
			//cases
			case onE:
				//do something
				break;
			case two:
				//do something
				break;
		....
		
			default:
			//do some thing
		}
		
		Note:
		-Cases have to be same type as expression, must be a constant or literal
		-duplicate case values are not allowed
		-break is use to terminate the sequence
		-if break is not used, it will continue to next case
		-default will execute when none of the above does
		-if default is not at the end, put break after it
