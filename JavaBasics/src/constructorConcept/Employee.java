	/*
	 * Constructor name should be same as class name, i can not give any other name
	 * is it looks like function? may be it is looks like function but it is not function
	 * constructor can not return anything, even void as well
	 * avoid writing the business logic in constructor
	 * Main purpose of the constructor is 
	 * 		Is to used initialize the class(instance) variables with the help of local variables
	 * using this keyword
	 * Constructor can be overloaded - Yes we can overload
	 * */
	
	/*
	 * Difference between constructor vs function
	 * Constructor looks like function but it is not function - Constructor name is same as class name
	 * But function could be any thing - 
	 * Constructor can not return any thing - not even void- but function may or may not return 
	 * Avoid business logic in constructor - but function should have business logic
	 * Constructor is used to initialize the class(instance) variables with the help of this key word
	 * Constructor can be overloaded, function also can be overloaded
	 * Constructor will be called automatically when we create the object of the class
	 * But function can be called using the object ref name if it is static use the classname
	 * Constructor will help to create object creation 
	 * Constructor will go to the class loader not to heap and stack
	 *
